Welcome to Screen-Simulator's documentation!
============================================
This Simulator generates CRISPR count data based on specific experiemental parameters such as the number of genes, percent of the library that is non-targeting control sgRNAs and the percent of genes that are enriched/depleted. Simulating count data allows for characterizing how well the CRISPR analysis tool MAGeCK classifies genes under different Simulator and MAGeCK parameters.
